# LuaJIT
A home for LuaJIT Binaries

Before using this, you must install go-pkg-config:
```
go install github.com/rjeczalik/pkgconfig
```

If you already have pkg-config installed (perhaps you are on Linux),
 the go version must be installed in your PATH before the real one.

 Afterwards, you may `go get` packages that use luajit-50 or
  luajit-51 in CGO.
